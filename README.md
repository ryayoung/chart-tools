## Install & Use
#### Must have python 3.9+
```
pip install chart-tools
```
```py
import chart_tools as ct
ct.load_data() # outputs available pre-defined data sources
ct.load_data('football') # outputs all the files and directories in the 'football' data source
```

# [Data Interface](https://github.com/ryayoung/chart-tools/blob/main/sampledata.md)

#### Easily load datasets and explore available sources with one line of code
- The [`load_data()`](https://github.com/ryayoung/chart-tools/blob/main/sampledata.md) function and [`DataSource`](https://github.com/ryayoung/chart-tools/blob/main/sampledata.md) object use Github's API to explore file structures in repositories containing `.csv` files, and easily load files into dataframes. Chart-tools has a pre-defined library (collection of repositories) for you to explore within your notebook and load data from.

#### Robust caching system designed for Jupyter notebooks, performing great with large datasets.
- Any dataframe you load gets cached in memory, remembering which pandas keyword arguments you used when loading the file. Next time you load it, you'll get a _copy_ of the cached dataframe, unless you pass different keyword arguments. Not only is this great for performance with large datasets, but it also eliminates the common need to declare a `df_raw = ...` and then use `df = df_raw.copy()` to get your original data again. 

#### Has a pre-defined library of data sources to explore, and lets you easily define your own library
- 

#### Save an entire Github repository file structure (csv files only) to your desktop
